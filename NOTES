Path forward:
- UI
  - Click+drag on background should pan both shapes
  - Touch: two finger both zooms and drags one of the shapes
  - Add share links
    ... which preserve the position of the features
  - Add transitions
  - Plug in Chosen for the dropdown lists
  - Add Google Analytics
  - Change "USA" to "United Kingdom" on home page
    --> placement is different than if you reload.
  - Get a new UI from Raven
  - Put the shapes on top of one another by default
  - Expand the <svg> behind the info boxes
  - Show "20% larger" in the UI somewhere

- Data curation:
  - Update information:
    - Source areas & populations from CIA factbook
    - Source state areas & populations from Wikipedia
    - Compare calculated and displayed areas
  - Consider down-sampling some shapes? (perf boost on mobile/tablet)
  - Generate my own continent features w/ higher resolution
  ~ Download Freebase Topics for all features & regenerate metadata
  - Add wiki URLs (and Freebase data) for generated features
  - Population source defaults to Freebase if not specified
  - Lots of missing population sources



I'm using http://www.jasondavies.com/maps/countries-by-area/ as a starting
point for projecting shape data using D3.

TopoJSON is similar to GeoJSON, but dramatically more compact.
Perhaps if I use TopoJSON, I could get away with not having a database!


This returns a list of GeoJSON objects:
topojson.feature(world, world.objects.countries).features

ogr commands
------------
List layers in a shapefile:
ogrinfo -so foo.shp

List fields in a shapefile layer:
ogrinfo -so foo.shp ne_50m_admin_0_countries_lakes

Drop the '-so' to see individual records.

Interesting fields in ne_50m_admin_0:
  pop_est (=313973000.000000)
  gdp_md_est (=15094000.000000)
  su_a3 (="USA")
  type (="Country")
  admin (="United States of America")
  name (="United States")
