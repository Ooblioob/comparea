Path forward:
- UI
  - Click+drag on background should pan both shapes
  - Touch: two finger both zooms and drags one of the shapes
  - Add share links which preserve the position of the features
  - Add transitions
  - Bug: change "USA" to "United Kingdom" on home page
    --> placement is different than if you reload.
  - Get a new UI from Raven
  - Put the shapes on top of one another by default?
  - Expand the <svg> behind the info boxes
  - Show "20% larger" in the UI somewhere
  - Add a favicon
  - Write an About page and link to it.
  - Make the UI responsive:
    - Hide the descriptions on mobile, tablet/portrait
    - Look into making the mobile UI landscape-only
  - Bug: shapes disappear when you rotate to lanscape on mobile
  - Bug: expanding window should expand existing shapes.
  x Add Google Analytics
  x Plug in -Chosen- Select2 for the dropdown lists

- Productionization
  - Set up Cloudfront, with an appropriate versioning scheme.
  - Use a CDN where appropriate (jQuery, D3, ...)

- Data curation:
  - Consider down-sampling some shapes? (perf boost on mobile/tablet)
  - Generate my own continent features w/ higher resolution
  - What are the other polygons in geometry.coordintes? (after index 0)
    --> e.g. in KGZ. Are they negative polygons?
  x Compare calculated and displayed areas
    x Try total area instead of land area
    x Update cia-area.txt one more time
    x Add Somaliland to Somalia
    x Add Western Sahara to Morocco
    x Add North Cyprus to Cyprus
    x Remove "France (Overseas Territories)"
    x Blacklist Western Sahara
    x Use Total Area for Eritrea (not sure why land area is so different)
  x Rename "Korea" and "Dem. Rep. Korea"
  x Missing features:
    x Add "Spain (Overseas territories)"
    x Remove "New Zealand (South Island)"
    x Add "France (Metropolitan)"
  x Update information:
    x No missing data
    x Figure out why Brazil, Germany and friends are missing Freebase topics
    x Add wiki URLs (and Freebase data) for generated features
    x Source areas & populations from CIA factbook
    x Source state areas & populations from Wikipedia
  x Download Freebase Topics for all features & regenerate metadata
  x Lots of missing population sources



I'm using http://www.jasondavies.com/maps/countries-by-area/ as a starting
point for projecting shape data using D3.

TopoJSON is similar to GeoJSON, but dramatically more compact.
Perhaps if I use TopoJSON, I could get away with not having a database!


This returns a list of GeoJSON objects:
topojson.feature(world, world.objects.countries).features

ogr commands
------------
List layers in a shapefile:
ogrinfo -so foo.shp

List fields in a shapefile layer:
ogrinfo -so foo.shp ne_50m_admin_0_countries_lakes

Drop the '-so' to see individual records.

Interesting fields in ne_50m_admin_0:
  pop_est (=313973000.000000)
  gdp_md_est (=15094000.000000)
  su_a3 (="USA")
  type (="Country")
  admin (="United States of America")
  name (="United States")
