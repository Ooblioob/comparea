There are 20 features with missing data that I care about:
ATA	Antarctica
USA48	United States (Contiguous 48)
NZS	New Zealand (South Island)
PRX	Portugal
ASIA	Asia
AF	Africa
EU	Europe
SA	South America
NLX	Netherlands (Overseas Territories)
ESX	Spain
NRX	Norway
ZAX	South Africa
NA	North America
CUW	Cura√ßao
IMN	Isle of Man
KOS	Kosovo
MKD	Macedonia
SRB	Serbia
KOR	Korea
MEX	Mexico


Sanity checks:
- Should have different values for area/population for these:
  Netherlands (overseas)
  Spain (overseas)
  France (metro/overseas)
  New Zealand (North/South/Total)
  Portugal (overseas)
  Norway (overseas)
  USA (total, 48)
- Denmark's area should be smaller than Greenland's
- Calculated and displayed areas should be within ~10%


Freebase issues:
x Myanmar should be Burma
- Germany, Brazil & a few others seem to have the wrong topics


Continents:
- Europe
    (includes all of Russia, which is wrong)
- Asia
    missing Asian Russia?
- North America
    good, probably shouldn't include Hawaii
- South America, Africa
  great!



Countries with overseas territories which skew the map:
- France
    x subunits.json has "Metropolitan France"
- Netherlands
    x subunits.json has "Kingdom of the Netherlands"
- New Zealand
    subunits.json has North Island / South Island
- Portugal
    x subunits.json has "Portuguese Republic"
- Chile
    x subunits.json has "Republic of Chile"
- Norway
    x subunits.json has "Kingdom of Norway"
- United States
    subunits.json has "USB", but this has issues with Lakes
- Spain
    x su_a3 = ESX
- South Africa
    x su_a3 = ZAX
